# snake-game
A super lightweight snake game using LemonadeJS Reactive library.

The snake game is a classical game where the player controls a long, thin creature that crawls across the screen, collecting food (in this case a "limonade"), unable to collide with its own body. Each time the snake eats a piece of food, its tail grows, increasing the game's score. The user controls the direction of the snake's head (up, down, left and right) and its body follows. In this repository we created a basic version of the game using LimonadeJS.
